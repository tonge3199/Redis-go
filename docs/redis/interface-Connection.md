___
## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- Network data as `[]byte` for Write operations
- Channel names as `string` for pub/sub operations
- Database index as `int` for database selection
- Password as `string` for authentication
- Command lines as `[][]byte` for transaction queuing
### Flow
1. Interface defines contract for Redis connection implementations
2. Provides basic I/O operations (`Write`, `Close`, `RemoteAddr`)
3. Manages authentication with password getter/setter methods
4. Handles pub/sub operations with channel subscription tracking
5. Supports Redis transactions with multi-state and command queuing
6. Manages database selection and replication role assignment
### Outputs
- Written byte count and error from `Write` method
- Connection remote address as `string`
- Current password, subscribed channels, and database index
- Transaction state, queued commands, and watched keys
- Boolean flags for slave/master and multi-state status
- Connection name identifier
